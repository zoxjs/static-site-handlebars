      Use your favorite templating engine combined with a powerful rendering pipeline.<br>
      Embed React into your pages to give them life.

      Built-in Server-side rendering for React will make your
      pages search engine friendly and let them load faster.

      Write your blog posts in markdown or create general purpose pages in yaml.
